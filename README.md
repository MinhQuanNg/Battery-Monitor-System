### Battery Management System

1. **Device Connection**
   - Displays connection status with the battery monitoring device.
   - Activates monitoring and tracking functions once connected.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Provides detailed information about the monitored battery pack.
   - Displays alerts for any alarms triggered.

   **General Information:**
   - Battery capacity (SoC percentage) with color indicators (Red, Yellow, Green).
   - Maximum and Minimum Voltage of the cells.
   - Voltage Difference, Total Voltage, and Average Voltage.
   - Maximum and Average Temperature.

   **Error Alerts:**
   - Notifies when parameters exceed thresholds.
   - Activates corresponding protection measures.

   **Detailed Information:**
   - Voltage and temperature of each cell.
   - Visual status with color indicators (Blue, Green, Red).

3. **Configuration Profiles**
   - Customize voltage and temperature thresholds for alerts and protection measures.
   - Provides battery properties (type, number of cells, maximum discharge/charge current, capacity).

4. **Error Alert Details**
   - Detailed alerts for low/high cell voltage, low/high total voltage, high temperature, and cell voltage imbalance.
   - Requires a password to change protection parameters.

5. **Access Saved Data**
   - Records and displays key battery parameters (Total Voltage, Maximum/Minimum Voltage, Maximum/Minimum Temperature) at different times.
   - Sorted from most recent to oldest data.
